<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

My name is **Fuxiang Zhai (翟福祥)**. I received my bachelor degree in School of Intelligence Science and Technology (School of Future Technology) at Xinjiang University, where I was extremely fortunate to be supervised by **Dr. Askar Hamdulla** and **Dr. Zhao Kai**. After an unsuccessful domestic graduate school recommendation for the class of 2024 due to unforeseen circumstances, I undertook an intensive three-month preparation for the graduate entrance exam but was unable to secure a position in my desired research group. I am currently in the process of applying for Mphil or Ph.D. programs for Fall 2025 admissions abroad. I am also open to various forms of collaboration. Please feel free to contact me via email.

My research interests includes computer vision, AI4Science(Medical Image Analysis and Multimodal Medical Large Model).
